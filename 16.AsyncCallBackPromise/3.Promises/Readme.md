### Promises basic
- Promises allow us to write asynchronous code that is much easier to read and understand. 
    - It is usually shorter, means flatten rather than nested.
    - Its am alternate for callback hell
- Promises is a java script object which represents the completion or failure of asynchronous operation(eventual process, that take time).
- Promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callback as a function.
