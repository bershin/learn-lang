### What is Objects(Python calls "dictionary")
- Objects are collection of properties
- Properties are a key-value pair.
- Object uses "custom keys" rather than using index.

### Representation of object
- const myvar = { key1:value1, key2:value2}
- All keys are converted to string
- value can be "john", 2, true
- Not in order
- Ways of accessing value
    - obj.key
    - obj["key"]
    - obj[key] -> if key is a variable.
