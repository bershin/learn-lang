Issue:
    With axios use then to get the data
    Cannot make axios to return data directly to variable. 
    It returns a promise object.
    So, the return value is not what we expect.
    We can use async and await to solve this issue.
### ASYNC Functions
- Async features
    - Depends heavily of promises
    - Asyn are nice syntatical suger for promises.
    - It gives clean syntax for promises.
- Async in front of a function return promise.

### AWAIT Functions
- Await is only used inside os a function declared as Async
- Await will pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved.
